# The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database
# and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year
# period 1999â€“2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

# Question 1
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?
# Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all
# sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

# cross-check
# sum(NEI[NEI$year == '2008','Emissions'])
